Our responsibilities end when the U.S. Postal Service accepts your mailing from us.

First Class mail takes 1 - 5 days (average) to reach its destination. Standard Class and Non Profit mail take 7 - 20 days (average) to reach its destination.

                          <p>
                          In order to maintain the most competitive print prices, we must utilize a number of paper stock sources and paper mills. We reserve the right to change our paper suppliers as necessary to assure you the best quality paper stocks available at the industry’s most competitive prices. We will make every effort to assure our online paper stock offerings remain consistent, reliable and predictable over time. However, we cannot control or be held accountable for paper production variances caused by independent paper mills and sources which are beyond our control.  Although the stated weights of our featured paper stocks will remain constant, there could be a slight difference in caliper, brightness or texture. Slight differences may or may not be evident when printing the exact same project, on the exact same selected paper stock, and using the exact same art file but ordered and printed on a different date. For example, you order a print project today (we’ll call it XYZ Flyers project) and you order it printed as 4/0 on 70 lb. Opaque Offset Smooth (Recycled). Three months from today, you place the exact same order, exact same art, same named paper stock, same project (XYZ Flyers). When you receive the project, you notice a slight difference in the paper stock (be it caliper, brightness or texture).  The slight difference will be within print industry standards for paper stock and mill industry tolerance levels (very similar to slight dye lot variations common in the carpet or fabric industry). We will not be held personally responsible or accountable, in any way, for these slight differences. Our position is a common print industry policy with regard to paper stock grades, paper mills and the varying slight differences from one source or mill to another concerning like weight and like named paper stocks purchased from different manufacturing resources.              </p>

                            Select your required size.  The size you select will determine the paper stocks which are available for your required size.  Once you select your size, the specific paper stocks available for that size will auto populate into the Stock/Substrate drop down menu.  If your required size falls somewhere in between the sizes shown, select the size that is slightly larger than your finished size.  You can than request Custom Cutting in the options menu.  For example, your finished piece is 8" x 10".  Choose the 8.5" x 11" size (which is slightly larger than your needed size) and select Custom Cutting to obtain your finished size.  You will be prompted to enter the 8" x 10" size in the Custom Cutting options area. If you require a size that is not available in the product category you've selected (too big or it does not fall just under an available size that can be custom cut) you may possibly find your required size in another print product category.  Please call customer service for assistance and if they cannot achieve your size goal online, they will direct you to our custom services department for assistance.

                            Below are the specific ink color options we offer: 
                            <p><b>CMYK</b> = Four Color Process or "Full Color"
                            </p><p><b>CMYK</b> stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black. This is an acronym for the 4 colors used in 4-color process printing, also known as "Full Color". The combination of these four colors (CMYK) approximates other colors in the full color spectrum. 
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            </p><p><b>4/0</b> = (Full Color Front / Blank Back)
                            </p><p>Four Color Process (Full Color) for the front side of your print product with a blank back side of your printed product. Four Color Process is defines as a system where a color image is separated into 4 different color values, by the   use of filters and screens. When transferred to the printing press and printed,      it reproduces the original full color image.
                            
                            </p><p><b>As an example:</b> A post card has color images (four color process or full color) on one side (front) and is blank on the back side. 
                            </p><p><b>4/1</b> = (Full Color Front / Black Back)
                            </p><p>Four Color Process (Full Color) for the front side of your printed product with black only for the back side of your printed product. 
                            </p><p><b>4/4:</b> = Four Color Process (Full Color) for the front side of your printed product and Four Color Process (Full Color) on the back side of your printed product.

                            <p>Select your required print product quantity and applicable turnaround time.  If your exact required quantity is not listed, you can choose to order the next higher quantity available or you can choose to place two different quantities that are closer to, or the exact total, that you need (see example below).  On higher quantities, over the maximum shown in the drop down, we may be able to quote your print project through our custom services department (offline) to meet your specific quantity needs.  
                            
                            </p><p><b>Example:</b> You need 6,000 finished pieces (the finished flat size for this example is 8.5" x 4" printed on 100 lb. Gloss Book).  You're ordering in the Flyer Product category.  The quantity menu shows 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000 on up.  If you place an order for 5,000 and 1,000 to get 6,000 pieces, your total net cost (in this example) will cost more than ordering 10,000 pieces.  This is the nature of the gang-run printing concept; one large order of more than you need may cost less than two smaller orders that match your quantity exactly.  Please note that shipping &amp; handling costs for the higher piece count may offset any savings.  You should compare total costs (two smaller orders equaling exact needed piece count (with S&amp;H) versus one single order of a larger than needed piece count (with S&amp;H) before you finalize your order.
                            
                            </p><p>Most of the time, the larger order will net a lower total price than two smaller orders.  You will have more than you need and you can possibly upsell the additional pieces (as overs) to your customer.

                            <h2>Custom Cutting:</h2>
                            </a>
                            <p>We provide custom  cutting on most products. Custom cutting refers to rectangular cuts only. <u>It  does not refer to angular, circular or any other special cut that is not  rectangular.</u> The custom cutting option requests a standard size to be cut  to a custom size. For example: Your finished piece needs to be 8" x  10". You have ordered an 8.5" x 11" standard size. You then  select custom cutting in the options section. In this example; you would choose  "1 Out Custom Cutting ". You will then be asked to enter the exact  finished size your one out custom cut needs to be, in this example, 8" x  10". <br>
                              <br>
                              The custom  cutting option can also be used for multiple Cut - Outs (Outs meaning number  up, for example 2 cut-outs of 7" x 5" on an 8.5" x 11"  standard size). If you ordered a quantity of 500 - 8.5" x 11" sheets  with a 2-Out custom cut of 7" x 5", you would receive 1,000 - 7"  x 5" finished pieces. <br>
                              <br>
                            Custom  cuts, from 1 - Out up to 12 - Out, may be available and the added charge for  these cut-outs will be shown as an option line item price in the <em>Product Overview</em>.</p>
                            <strong>Useful Tip:</strong> Using custom cuts can often help you achieve finished piece quantity totals  outside the standard quantities offered. For example, by ordering a 3 - Out  custom cut on a larger sheet at an order quantity of 2,500, you would yield  7,500 finished pieces. If the standard quantity break for an exact specific  size and quantity is goes from 5,000 to 10,000, you might check to see if ordering  a 3 - Out custom cut on a larger sheet size might be a more cost effective way  to reach your needed quantity.

                            Many of our card stock products offer round cornering as an option.  You can select round cornering for 1 corner, 2 corners, 3 corners or all 4 corners.  Some products may only offer a 4 round corner option. The round corner cut is a ¼" round corner cut.  The art file you submit must show the location of the corner cuts and it's important not to place text or logo art near the corners being cut.

                            Many card stock products and our full size catalogs are offered with a drill hole option.  The card stocks offer a one-hole drill option.  The size of the drill hole is 1/8".  Full size catalog orders offer the option of a three hole binder style or five hole automotive style drill.  The size of the binder style three hole drill is 1/4". The size of the automotive five hole drill is the standard auto industry catalog drill formation for a desk top multiple catalog rack.  
                            
                            <p>It's important that file(s) you submit for card stock projects (those that offer the single drill hole option) have the specific drill hole location clearly identified in the art file(s).  Art files for catalogs ordered with a three hole or five hole auto drill option should be designed so the drill holes do not cut into essential text copy or graphics.  Art files submitted for orders requesting a single drill hole option that do not identify the drill hole location will be rejected and a new re-submitted art file may be requested.  There is a fee for re-submitting art files different from the originally submitted order art files.

                            Shrink wrapping is available as an option on many products.  Depending on the product, you can choose from shrink wrapped bundles of 25, 50 or 100 pieces.
                            Shrink wrapping makes it easier for end user distribution of small, medium and larger print runs.  Shrink wrapping also keeps the printed materials clean and provides moisture protection.  Shrink wrapping also adds protection from dog-earring of the literature corners, keeping them in good condition in brief cases, catalog cases, cars, trucks and other storage containers.

                            We offer you a drop ship sample option.  It's always a good idea to keep samples of all your printed work.  Keeping a few samples in your files is smart too!  Ordering samples for your personal portfolio might help you remember a specific print project when it comes time to place a new order.  If your order is shipping to a location other than your home or office, you may want to have a small portion sent directly to you for your records. Note: There is a charge for this option and the sample quantity is typically 10 pieces.

                            For a small fee, we will archive your print ready art files.  This is especially convenient when you are placing regular orders, week in, week out or month in, month out, for the same exact printed piece (business cards, brochures, flyers, etc.).  We will archive your art files for these types of projects for a period of 6 months.  This can save you time and energy as you will not have to locate and upload these repeat order art files each time you place an order.  If you travel or work from a remote office or varying locations, this is a great option.  Say you are traveling in LA but need to order business cards for your office in New York for meeting when you get home. By saving the art files in our system, you do not have to be at your office or home computer to upload the art files and get your order placed and moving.  You can access this web site from any computer, anywhere, 24/7 and have instant access to your repeat order art files. If you're mobile or global, archived art files for repeat orders, archived on our site, can be a great asset. Note: There is a charge for this option.

                            Clear, round wafer tabs are often used for holding together folded brochures, flyers and catalogs to retain their integrity for long term storage or mailing purposes.  They can also be used to seal in loose inserts placed inside brochures or catalogs.  The clear 1" round wafer tabs are perforated for easy separation when needed.  Choose from one or two tab options.  Smaller folded brochures, mini catalogs or low page count full size catalogs may only require one wafer seal tab, while larger brochures or catalogs may require two wafer tabs.  If you are unsure whether your project needs a wafer tab, please contact our customer service department for assistance.

                            If the horizontal or vertical scoring option (or both) are shown on the option menu for your print order, your project is most likely being produced on a medium to heavy weight card stock which may or may not require the piece to be produced flat with a score for manual folding later.  Our greeting cards, for instance, come with a standard score included in the print price.  Scoring a card weight paper stock helps to preserve the integrity and straightness of the manual fold and allows the card stock to easily lie flat when closed.  As an example, if you were to attempt to fold a piece of card board in half and you tried to fold it without scoring it first (say using your finger nail or a coin) the odds of it folding exactly in half in a clean, straight line would be low.  If you are unsure whether your project needs scoring, please contact our customer service department for assistance.

                            Many of our products offer a vertical or horizontal perforation option.  If you've clicked on this "learn more" button, than more than likely the product you're in the middle of ordering offers this option.  The vertical or horizontal perforation option is basically a straight line perforation designed for pieces that require an easy manual tear-off of a rectangular portion of the printed product.   For example, you've ordered a tri-fold brochure and one of the panels (left or right) of the brochure need to be perforated as it is meant to be separated and used as a Business Reply Card (BRC).  A perforation will make it easy to cleanly tear it off and mail it.  It could also be a coupon, sample swatch, etc. or anything that was meant to be separated from the larger printed piece with ease.
